# Llama Index

## What is the llama-index package?

LlamaIndex is a data framework for LLM-based applications that benefit from context augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. LlamaIndex provides the essential abstractions to more easily ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data, resulting in safe and reliable injection into LLMs for more accurate text generation.

## What is the llama-index-llms-groq package?

An extension of llama-index that supports integration with Groq, 


llama-index-llms-groq (v0.1.3): An extension of llama-index that supports integration with Groq, a processor designed for accelerated AI computations. This package likely optimizes LLM queries specifically for Groq hardware.

groq (v0.4.2): The core library for interacting with Groq processors, providing the tools and interfaces to deploy AI models on Groq hardware.

llama-index-embeddings-huggingface (v0.2.0): Adds support for Hugging Face embeddings within llama-index, allowing you to use Hugging Face's embedding models for enhanced text similarity and semantic search.
