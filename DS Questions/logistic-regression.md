# Logistic Regression

## What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). The goal of logistic regression is to find the best fitting model to describe the relationship between the feature of interest and the independent variables.

## What are the assumptions behind logistic regression?

1. The dependent variable must be dichotomous in nature.
2. There should be no outliers in the data.
3. There should be no high correlation between the independent variables.
4. There should be a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
5. The sample size should be sufficiently large.

## What is the sigmoid function?

## Is there any distribution related assumption in LR?

## What is the interpretation of weights in logistic regression?

## What is the loss function?

## Explain any method through which we get this loss function?

## What are the difference evaluation metrics for LR?

## Why accuracy is not a good metric here?

## What is precision & recall?

## Which is more important? Precision or recall?

## What is F1 & F2 score?

## What is AOC & AUC?

## What is on x-axis & y-axis in AUC?

## How do we calculate the area under curve (is there any formula for area?)

## Given a scenario which each will be more important, precision or recall?

## How can we increase precision by not reducing recall much?
