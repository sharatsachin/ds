    "## How does gradient descent work for linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is based on the observation that if the function $J({\\theta})$ is differentiable in a neighborhood of a point $\\theta$, then $J({\\theta})$ decreases fastest if one goes from $\\theta$ in the direction of the negative gradient of $J({\\theta})$ at $\\theta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus if we repeatedly apply the following update rule, ${\\theta := \\theta - \\alpha \\nabla J(\\theta)}$ for a sufficiently small value of **learning rate**, $\\alpha$, we will eventually converge to a value of $\\theta$ that minimizes $J({\\theta})$.\n",

    "\n",
    "For a specific paramter $\\theta_j$, the update rule is \n",

    "$$\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} J({\\theta}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the definition of $J({\\theta})$, we get\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the alternative to batch gradient descent?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is the learning rate in gradient descent?\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate, $\\alpha$, is a hyperparameter that controls how much we are adjusting the weights of our network with respect to the loss gradient. It is a scalar value, typically between $0$ and $1$. If the learning rate is too small, the model will take a long time to converge; if it is too large, the model may overshoot the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the different types of gradient descent?\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that looks at every example in the entire training set on every step is called **batch gradient descent (BGD)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the cost function $J$ is convex, all local minima are also global minima, so in this case gradient descent can converge to the global solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** (also incremental gradient descent), where we repeatedly run through the training set, and for each training example, we update the parameters using gradient of the error for that training example only.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the trade-offs between batch and stochastic gradient descent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas BGD has to scan the entire training set before taking a single step, SGD can start making progress right away with each example it looks at. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, SGD gets $\\theta$ *close* to the minimum much faster than BGD. However it may never *converge* to the minimum, and $\\theta$ will keep oscillating around the minimum of $J(\\theta)$; but in practice these values are reasonably good approximations. Also, by slowly decreasing $\\alpha$ to $0$ as the algorithm runs, $\\theta$ converges to the global minimum rather than oscillating around it.\n",

    "## How is regularization used in linear regression? Types of regularization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a technique to reduce overfitting in machine learning. This technique discourages learning a more complex or flexible model, by shrinking the parameters towards $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can regularize machine learning methods through the cost function using $L1$ regularization or $L2$ regularization. $L1$ regularization adds an absolute penalty term to the cost function, while $L2$ regularization adds a squared penalty term to the cost function. A model with $L1$ norm for regularisation is called **lasso regression**, and one with (squared) $L2$ norm for regularisation is called **ridge regression**.

    "\n",
    "Elastic Net regularization is a combination of $L1$ and $L2$ regularization. It adds both the absolute and squared penalty terms to the cost function, with two hyperparameters $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ to control the strength of each regularization term.\n",

    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence**: The residuals are independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Normality**: The residuals follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "4. **Equal Variance (Homoscedasticity)**: The residuals have constant variance.\n",

    "## How do you check for linearity in linear regression? Fixes?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check for linearity by plotting the residuals against the fitted values. If the residuals show a pattern (e.g., a curve), the relationship may not be linear. You can include polynomial terms (e.g., \\(X^2\\), \\(X^3\\)) or transform variables (log, square root) to capture non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do you check for independence in linear regression? Fixes?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check for independence using the Durbin-Watson test or by plotting the residuals against time. If the residuals show a pattern over time, there may be autocorrelation. You can add lag terms / use time series models like ARIMA to account for autocorrelation.\n",

    "## How do you check for normality in linear regression? Fixes?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check for normality using a Q-Q plot, the Shapiro-Wilk test, or by plotting a histogram of the residuals. If the Q-Q plot has a S-shaped curve or a bow-shaped curve, the residuals are not normally distributed. If the residuals are not normally distributed, you can transform the variables or consider robust regression techniques.\n",

    "## What is a Q-Q plot?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a graphical tool to help us assess if a set of data plausibly came from some theoretical distribution such as a Normal or exponential.

    "## How do you check for homoscedasticity in linear regression? Fixes?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check for homoscedasticity by plotting the residuals against the fitted values or using the Breusch-Pagan test. If the residuals show a pattern (e.g., a cone shape), you can transform the response variable or use Weighted Least Squares (WLS). Transforming the response variable (e.g., log, square root) can stabilize the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do you check for multicollinearity in linear regression? Fixes?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check for multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) or by looking at the correlation matrix. If the VIF is greater than 5-10 or if there are high correlations between predictors, you can remove or combine correlated variables, or use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",

    "Endogeneity occurs when the independent variables are correlated with the residuals. This can happen when:\n",
    "1. Omitted variable bias: Important variables are missing from the model.\n",
    "2. Simultaneity: The relationship between variables is bidirectional. For example, the prices of goods and the demand for those goods.\n",

    "## What will happen (challenges) if we try to predict categorical values using linear regression? (Using a threshold)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Why we divide the value by 2 in loss function?\n",

    "## Why we use square & root under in loss function why not take the absolute value?\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Coef**: Estimated coefficients for the predictors. Represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the predictor.\n",
    "2. **Std. Error**: Standard error of the coefficient estimate. Measures the variability in the estimate. A lower value indicates a more precise estimate.\n",
    "3. **t-statistic**: The coefficient divided by its standard error. Measures the significance of the coefficient estimate. Value greater than 2 indicates significance.\n",
    "4. **P-value**: Probability of observing the t-statistic if the null hypothesis is true. Typically, p < 0.05 is considered significant.\n",
    "5. **95% Confidence Intervals**: Range of values within which the true coefficient is likely to fall with 95% confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do the model diagnostics (Omnibus, Skew, Kurtosis, Jarque-Bera, Durbin-Watson, Condition Number) represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Omnibus**: Tests the skewness and kurtosis of the residuals. A value close to zero indicates normal distribution. \n",
    "2. **Skew**: Measures the symmetry of the residuals. A value close to zero indicates normal distribution. $ < 0$ indicates negative skew and $ > 0$ indicates positive skew.\n",
    "3. **Kurtosis**: Measures the heaviness of the tails of the residuals. A value close to zero indicates normal distribution. $ < 3$ indicates light tails and $ > 3$ indicates heavy tails.\n",
    "4. **Jarque-Bera**: Tests the skewness and kurtosis of the residuals. A value close to zero indicates normal distribution.\n",
    "5. **Durbin-Watson**: Tests for autocorrelation in the residuals. Value of 2 indicates no autocorrelation, while values < 2 or > 2 indicate positive or negative autocorrelation.\n",
    "6. **Condition Number**: Measures multicollinearity in the model. Values > 30 indicate multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the drawbacks of the linear model?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assumes linear relationship between predictors and response.\n",
    "2. Sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "3. Assumes independence of observations.\n",
    "4. Assumes homoscedasticity.\n",
    "5. Assumes normality of residuals.\n",
    "6. Prone to overfitting with many predictors.\n",
    "7. Cannot capture non-linear relationships."
